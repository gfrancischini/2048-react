<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About

The basic idea of this project was to mimic the 2048 by Gabriele using React Native views and animations.
So the same animations that were implemented using CSS were created using pure React Native animations on the tile

### Developed With

- [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/) - React Native is a framework that lets you create truly native apps and doesn't compromise your users' experiences;
- [React Native Async Storage](https://react-native-async-storage.github.io/async-storage/) - React Native AsyncStorage is a simple, unencrypted, asynchronous, persistent, storage system which stores the data globally in the app;
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale;
